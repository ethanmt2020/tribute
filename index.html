        <p>Thomas Jefferson (April 13, 1743–July 4, 1826) was a leading  Founding Father of the United States, 
            the author of the Declaration of Independence (1776) and he served as the third President of the US (1801–1809). 
            Jefferson was a committed Republican – arguing passionately for liberty, democracy and devolved power. 
            Jefferson also wrote the Statute for Religious Freedom in 1777 – it was adopted by the state of Virginia in 1786. 
            Jefferson was also a noted polymath with wide-ranging interests from architecture to gardening, philosophy, 
            literature and education. Although a slave owner himself, Jefferson sought to introduce a bill (1800) to end slavery in all 
            Western territories. 
            As President, he signed a bill to ban the importation of slaves into the US (1807). </p>
